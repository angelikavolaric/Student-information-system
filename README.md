Student information system

Implement a simple student information system, where the user can:
   - add a new student (basic student information and courses that student will be part of),
   - edit the student (courses only),
   - delete a student.
 You will also have to implement a page with an overview of all students (a table where each row displays student information). Table should have pagination with 20 students per page.

Attached to this email is a screenshot of a different table. Try to approach its appearance, to test your HTML and CSS skills. Ignore features that are not included in task description (like timezone dropdown, expandable rows, "super admin" tag, left sidebar...)

 Requirements:
 - Routing (/overview page should be lazily loaded)

 Required technologies:
 - Latest Angular
 - PrimeNg (component library)
